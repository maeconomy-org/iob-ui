# Project Progress

## What Works

1. Object Management

   - Hierarchical object structure with nested views
   - Property management for materials
   - Object creation, editing, and deletion
   - Object visualization in table, explorer, and column views

2. Process Flow Management

   - Material input/output tracking
   - Quantity specification for materials
   - Template-based quick object creation
   - Intelligent output suggestions

3. UI Components
   - Sheet components for object details and editing
   - Modal system with scrollable content
   - Table views with consistent action buttons
   - Dropdown menus for row actions

## What's Left to Build

1. Process Visualization

   - Flow diagram visualization
   - Material transformation tracking
   - Process history views
   - Process analytics and metrics

2. Advanced Object Management

   - Bulk operations for objects
   - Advanced filtering and sorting
   - Object version history
   - Component modeling improvements

3. User Experience
   - Responsive design refinements
   - Mobile view optimizations
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Performance optimizations for large data sets

## Current Status

1. Process System

   - Basic process flow tracking implemented
   - Input/output relationships working
   - Material properties and quantities integrated
   - Process details view functioning

2. UI Consistency

   - Standardized import structure using index.ts
   - Consistent sheet usage for editing/viewing objects
   - Action buttons implemented consistently in tables
   - Scrollable modal content for better UX

3. Object Management
   - Object hierarchy navigation working
   - Object property management functioning
   - UUID-based object identification
   - Object relationships tracked

## Known Issues

1. Process System

   - No visual representation of material flows
   - Limited validation for input/output relationships
   - Needs more templates for common materials
   - Process history not implemented

2. UI Components

   - Some tables might need responsive improvements
   - Sheet transitions could be smoother
   - Dropdown positioning in dense tables
   - Mobile view needs optimization

3. Data Management
   - No persistent storage implementation yet
   - No data export/import functionality
   - Limited validation for property values
   - Performance with large data sets untested

## Next Steps

1. Immediate

   - Complete process flow visualization
   - Add more material templates
   - Improve table responsiveness
   - Enhance property validation

2. Short Term

   - Implement process history tracking
   - Add visual flow diagrams
   - Enhance data validation
   - Improve mobile experience

3. Long Term
   - Add advanced data analytics
   - Implement full data persistence
   - Create reporting tools
   - Add user role management
