# Active Context

## Current Focus

1. Process Flow Management

   - Material flow tracking between objects
   - Input/output relationships
   - Process visualization
   - Property management

2. UI Consistency
   - Consistent component usage across the application
   - Sheet components for details/edit views
   - Action buttons in table views
   - Modal scrolling behavior

## Recent Changes

1. Process Flow System

   - Added ProcessFormV2 with improved UI
   - Created QuickObjectForm for rapid material creation
   - Implemented input/output quantity tracking
   - Added intelligent suggestions for outputs

2. UI Components
   - Updated modal components to use scrollable content
   - Standardized table views with consistent action buttons
   - Unified import structure using index.ts files
   - Consistent sheet usage for object editing/viewing

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Tasks

   - Complete process flow visualization
   - Enhance material relationship tracking
   - Improve table responsiveness
   - Add more material templates

2. Future Improvements
   - Add process flow diagram visualization
   - Implement material history tracking
   - Add advanced property management
   - Enhance data validation

## Active Decisions

1. Architecture

   - Using index.ts for component exports
   - Sheet components for detailed views
   - Modal components for confirmations
   - Consistent action patterns across tables

2. Object Management

   - Hierarchical object structure
   - UUID-based identification
   - Property-based metadata
   - Flow-based relationships

3. UI/UX
   - Dropdown menus for table row actions
   - Consistent edit/view patterns
   - Scrollable content in modals/sheets
   - Template-based object creation

## Current Challenges

1. Technical

   - Complex state management for object relationships
   - Performance with large object hierarchies
   - Property validation across different objects
   - Consistent data handling

2. UX/UI

   - Balancing detail vs simplicity in process forms
   - Maintaining consistency across different views
   - Effective visualization of material flows
   - User-friendly property management

3. Data Structure
   - Representing complex material relationships
   - Tracking quantities throughout processes
   - Maintaining history of material transformations
   - Ensuring data integrity

## Development Focus

1. Priority Features

   - Process flow management
   - Material transformation tracking
   - Object relationship visualization
   - Property management

2. Code Quality

   - Consistent component patterns
   - Clean imports through index files
   - Type safety for objects and properties
   - Reusable UI components

3. User Experience
   - Streamlined process creation
   - Consistent object management
   - Intuitive material flow visualization
   - Responsive and accessible interfaces
