# Project Brief: IoB (Internet of Buildings)

## Project Overview

IoB is a modern web application designed for tracking and managing building materials, components, and structures for government and municipal use. It provides a comprehensive interface for creating digital material passports of buildings, tracking their components, and managing associated processes.

## Core Requirements

1. Building Object Management

   - Hierarchical structure (building → floors → rooms → components)
   - Material properties and metadata
   - Component relationships and dependencies
   - CRUD operations for building elements

2. Material Process Management

   - Material tracking and monitoring
   - Construction process management
   - Material-object relationships
   - Lifecycle status tracking

3. User Interface
   - Modern, responsive design
   - Intuitive navigation through building hierarchies
   - Efficient data visualization of building components
   - Accessibility compliance

## Technical Goals

1. Performance

   - Fast page loads for large building datasets
   - Efficient handling of complex hierarchies
   - Smooth navigation through building structures

2. Maintainability

   - Generic object model for future extensibility
   - Type safety for complex data structures
   - Component reusability across different building types

3. Scalability
   - Support for multiple buildings and organizations
   - Extensible data model for future material types
   - Future-proof design for regulatory changes

## Project Scope

- Frontend application development
- Building component and material management
- Material passport visualization
- Construction process tracking
- Data collection and reporting for municipalities
